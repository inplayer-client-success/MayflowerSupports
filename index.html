    content="Mayflower Supports is a charity concert raising money for Theatre Charities that are supporting the Theatre Industry through these difficult times. The COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating for the industry with redundancy consultations announced in top locations around the country including Manchester royal exchange, Birmingham Hippodrome and Newcastle Theatre Royal. In addition revered theatres such as Southampton’s Nuffield Theatre has already gone into administration. Particular hardship has fallen on the community of creatives, performers and technical staff who are freelancers with no contractual security. They have fallen through the gaps of the government’s income support schemes and many have struggled to find alternative income solutions. With the majority of Theatres closed until next year all have continued to demonstrate resilience towards an unprecedented change to our society.

    Mayflower Supports aims to bring a lifeline to all those significantly affected by these unprecedented times through backing the charities that are providing invaluable financial and emotional support to our community.
